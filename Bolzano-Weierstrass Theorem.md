Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem

**Theorem**: Every bounded sequence in Rn\\mathbb{R}^nRn has a convergent subsequence.

Proof) 

1. suppose E \= A U B , if E contains infinitely many x\_n , at least one of A , B must contain infinitely many x\_n.  
2. if {x\_n} is bounded sequence, then for all n in N, x\_n are all in I\_0, l\_0 \= \[a,b\],

	cut l\_0 into two and at least one of them contains infinitely many {x\_n}, …..

3. Finally, lx\_n\_k \- xl \<= length(l\_k) \<= (b-a)/2^k , k is in N

Hence, x\_n\_k \-\> x when k \-\> infinity(k \> N when N is large enough )

Think : squeeze theorem shows how x\_n\_k(sub sequence) goes to x when x is a limit point.  
As I(=\[a,b\]) is divided, each x\_n\_k is selected in I\_k(=length(\[a,b\])/2^k) if l\_k has infinitely many {x\_n}, and also by this logic, I\_0 contains I\_1 contains l\_2…..
