Cauchy sequence theorem

**Theorem**: A sequence in a metric space (X,d) is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.

for some n , m \>= N(N is big enough) \-\> l x\_n \- x\_m l \< epsilon for any positive epsilon.

if {x\_n} is cauchy, then if some sub sequence {x\_n\_k} converges to x, then {x\_n} also converges to x 

since lx\_n \- x\_n\_kl \+ lx\_n\_k \- xl \< epsilon.

For R\_n , cauchy sequence \= {x\_n} converges
