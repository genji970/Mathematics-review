Compact set

### **Definition:**

A set K in a topological space X is said to be **compact** if every **open cover** of K has a **finite subcover**.

More formally:

* A collection of open sets {Uα}α∈A\\{U\_{\\alpha}\\}\_{\\alpha \\in A}{Uα​}α∈A​ is called an **open cover** of K if K⊆⋃α∈AUαK \\subseteq \\bigcup\_{\\alpha \\in A} U\_{\\alpha}K⊆⋃α∈A​Uα​.  
* K is compact if, for any open cover {Uα}α∈A\\{U\_{\\alpha}\\}\_{\\alpha \\in A}{Uα​}α∈A​ of K, there exists a **finite subset** of these open sets, say {Uα1,Uα2,…,Uαn}\\{U\_{\\alpha\_1}, U\_{\\alpha\_2}, \\ldots, U\_{\\alpha\_n}\\}{Uα1​​,Uα2​​,…,Uαn​​}, such that K⊆⋃i=1nUαiK \\subseteq \\bigcup\_{i=1}^{n} U\_{\\alpha\_i}K⊆⋃i=1n​Uαi​​.

my opinion/thinking : If space is euclidean, and further suppose space is R\_1, to satisfy compact set’s definition, we should find least set.

Suppose A \= {1/n} U 0 sequence. since 0 \- 1/n is less than any positive epsilon, A is bounded and closed. Hence, A is compact set in R\_1
